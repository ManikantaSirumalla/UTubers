          <h2 class="text-center">About Project</h2>
          <p> This is one of our multiple projects that completely helps to get rid off real life corporate issue. In
            this application we tried to sort the issue for making digital marketing less time consuming i.e, this
            appplication helps companies to meet all the active and popular social media sensations on youtube
            under one roof and in consideration with that companies can reach out to the youtubers directly to promote
            and to advertise its products on their youtube channel. We as a team thought that this could be innovative
            if at all everythings works fine and this idea may help many companies to save their time in searching of
            popular youtubers unlike searching mannually.
